# RSA Algorithm Implementation in Python

This repository provides a simple implementation of the RSA algorithm in Python, including key generation, encryption, and decryption functions.

## Repository Structure

- **README.md**: This file.
- **rsa.py**: Contains the RSA algorithm implementation.
- **main.py**: Demonstrates how to use the RSA functions.

## How to Run

Run the main script:
```
python main.py
```

## Note

This implementation is intended for educational purposes only and uses small prime sizes (default 16 bits) for demonstration. For any practical or secure use, a much larger key size and a robust library should be used.
